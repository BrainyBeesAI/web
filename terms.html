                                other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy

                                been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
                                essential purpose.</p>
                            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability
                                for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations
                                may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
                                extent permitted by law.</p>
